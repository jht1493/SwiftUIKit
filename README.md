## About SwiftUIKit

`SwiftUIKit` adds extra functionality to `SwiftUI`, like extensions to existing types and completely new views, pickers, utilites, services etc. 

`SwiftUIKit` is divided into these areas:

* Cameras
* Colors
* Data
* Documents
* Environment
* Extensions
* Files
* Gestures
* Navigation
* Pickers
* Presentation
* Sharing
* Styles
* Views

You can explore the sections in the [documentation][Documentation] and the demo app.



## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/SwiftUIKit.git
```

### CocoaPods

```
pod DSSwiftUIKit
```



## Supported Platforms

SwiftUIKit supports `iOS 13`, `macOS 11`, `tvOS 13` and `watchOS 6`.

Many parts of the library only supports a few or a certain platform, where they make sense.

Also, while some views compile on a certain platform, they may not render correctly. Please help improve this library by submitting PRs that improve the rendering on e.g. macOS.  



## Documentation

The SwiftUIKit documentation contains extensive information, code examples etc. and makes it easy to overview the various parts of the library.

You can either [download][Documentation] the documentation or build it directly in Xcode, using `Product/Build Documentation`.



## Demo Application

This project contains a demo app that lets you explore many of SwiftUIKit's features through interactive demos.

Together with the documentation and SwiftUI previews, I hope you'll find it easy to understand how the various parts of the library works.

To run the demo app, just open and run the `Demo/Demo.xcodeproj` project. It's a universal app project, but the `macOS` app is currenty not functional.
