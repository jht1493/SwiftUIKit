## 0.9.9

This is the RC for the first major `1.0` release.

This release wraps more logic within `os` checks to make the code build on `macOS`, `tvOS` and `watchOS`.

WIth this release, the demo app has been rebuilt as a universal app that lets you explore SwiftUIKit through interactive demos. As a result, I have removed the separate readmes to avoid having to keep multiple copies of the documentation alive.

The release also adds new views and utils:

* `AsyncImage` is a view that loads an async image from the network.
* `AsyncImageLoader` is an observable class that loads an async image from the network.
* `Camera` wraps an `ImagePicker` that is configured for `.camera` source type.
* `CircularProgressBar` renders a percentual progress in a circle.
* `CircularProgressView` renders a round spinner.
* `ConditionalView` returns the provided content view if the provided expression is `true`, else a fallback view (`EmptyView` by default).
* `FetchedDataView` shows a spinner, fetched data or a failure view.
* `FullScreenCoverContext/Provider` lets you handle full screen covers like sheets, alerts etc.
* `MinWidthButton` applies a min width to it's wrapped content.
* `OptionalView` returns the provided content view if the provided value is not nil, else a fallback view (`EmptyView` by default).
* `SimpleMultiPicker` renders a simple list of buttons that can be used to pick multiple options in a list of available options.
* `SimpleOptionalPicker` renders a simple list of buttons that can be used to pick multiple options in a list of available options.
* `SimplePickerScreen` can be used to present a simple picker with a main title and an OK button.
* `SimpleSinglePicker` renders a simple list of buttons that can be used to pick a single option in a list of available options.
* `WidthVStack` lists views in a vertical stack and provides them with with the largest view width.

The release also adds a highly performant `CollectionView`, based on the amazing work of  [@defagos](https://twitter.com/defagos), which can be found [here](https://github.com/defagos/SwiftUICollection):

The collection view can be configured with various layouts, like `.shelves` and `.grid`.

The release also makes some changes in the various `presentation` contexts:

* Passing around views could mess up `@Binding` properties and cause the views to not update.
* The code has been refactored to use closures instead, which solves this problem.
* My eternal gratitude to [@hybridcattt](https://twitter.com/hybridcattt) for realizing that this was what caused problems.  

Finally, this release also has some breaking changes:

*  `DocumentCamera`, `FilePicker` and `ImagePicker` have been written to behave more like eachother.
*  `FlippableView` is improved with new features and better result, but breaks previous api:s.
*  `LazyView` and `LazyNavigationView` are removed, since I realized that SwiftUI handles this now.
* `MultiPageView` has been renamed to `PageView`.



## 0.9.8

This release contains a new `LazyView` and `LazyNavigationView`, which can be used to improve performance, since they resolve views upon presentation.

## 0.9.6

After comments, the `View+Screenshot` `takeScreenshot` function has been renamed to `snapshot`. The `origin` parameter has `.zero` as default value.

## 0.9.3

This means that these contexts get access to this function:

## 0.9.1

This version adds improved support for watchOS, tvOS and macOS.

The bump version process has been improved to also add linting and a unit test confirmation.



## 0.9.0

There are now more convenient `alert`, `sheet` and `toast` view modifiers, that take a context instead of a binding and a content.

This version contains more breaking changes for the toast components.

* `ToastContext`, `SheetContext` and `AlertContext` share a base class.
* There is a new `ToastProvider` that can be used with `ToastContext`.

You can now use any views with the toast context and modifier, so it should make the toast easier to understand and to use.

You can use them like this:

@State private var size: CGSize = .zero
UIColor.red.bindGeometry(to: $height)¬†{ $0.size.height }
```


## 0.4.1

* `font(name:, style:, weight:)` can also be used to apply custom fonts.
* `shadow(_ style:)` can be used to apply a `ShadowStyle`.

The release also adds new view extensions:
